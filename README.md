# My Second Brain Website Project 

## Project Overview

I created this Obsidian to personal website tool from scratch! The scripts to convert the markdown files to HTML files, the website path creation, the UI -- all of it is done by me. I know other tools that are generally accessible exist, but I wanted to test my own abilities and create something custom for myself! 

All that to say, this tool is customized to my personal needs. I am not currently planning to release this as a general tool. If this serves as a point of inspiration for someone, that's great! But I'm not making customizations for other people (at this point in time).

## Why am I making my notes and work public? 

My ADHD makes it impossible for me to keep track of anything. So I thought it might be easier for me to keep track of the knowledge I acquire if I make it publicly accessible. Plus, it might help someone else out!
