- Made a lot of progress on the obsidian-site project!! 
	- Basically done with most of the architecture, and working on the visuals now

- Told myself that I will take a break and ended up working on the project for hours again ehe. Making good progress though! I'll attach a screenshot of what the website is looking like right now. (I think it'll be fun to see the evolution going forward!)
