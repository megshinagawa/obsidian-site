# ZETTELKASTEN METHOD

## WHAT IS THE ZETTELKASTEN? 

The zettelkasten is a method of personal knowledge management popularized by the German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. The German term "zettelkasten" directly translates in English to the "slip box" method. It is an appropriate name for the system because the original method is an analog system that uses slip-boxes and index cards to take interconnected notes. 

This method of note taking is unique in that it takes a bottom-up approach to learning. Rather than forcing yourself to fit into a pre-defined structure, you are able to develop a structure that is catered to your interest as you accumulate more and more notes. 

It is important to note here that although the zettelkasten is a system for note taking, its end goal is not to collect and hoard notes. Its end goal is to assist you in creating output from the knowledge you acquire in life. As the author of *How to Take Smart Notes* writes, "The slip-box is not a collection of notes. Working with it is less about retrieving specific notes and more about being pointed to relevant facts and generating insight by letting ideas mingle."

## ZETTELKASTEN ANATOMY 

In order to understand how to implement this method, we need to first understand its anatomy. The Zettelkasten is made up of four types of notes: 

1. Fleeting notes 
2. Reference or literature notes
3. Permanent or evergreen notes 
4. Indexes 

### FLEETING NOTES

Fleeting notes are temporary and doesn't actually make it into the slip-box. However, it is an important part of capturing one's ideas and findings. Fleeting notes are can be captured in many different forms, and the main point is to note them down to be processed later. 

### REFERENCE OR LITERATURE NOTES

Depending on who you talk to, the definition of these two notes can be the same or different. Generally speaking, reference or literature notes refer to notes taken on a piece of media that you consume. Those who differentiate between the two treat reference notes as a catchall space for notes taken directly from a source of media and literature notes as atomic notes derived from them. Note here that reference notes are a collection of quotes and ideas from the book with occasional jots of original notes whereas literature notes must be written completely in your own words. 

### PERMANENT OR EVERGREEN NOTES 

There are several critical properties that make a note permanent or evergreen. 

- That they are atomic, meaning that each note contains only one thought or idea. It's important here that these notes are thorough enough to capture the whole thought, but concise enough to be easily understood.

- That they are not context specific. When writing a permanent or evergreen note, you should assume that you are writing to an audience with only a base level understanding of the subject. This allows the notes to be easily connected to other thoughts and ideas because they are well generalized. 

- That they are interconnected with other thoughts and ideas. The whole point of the Zettelkasten is to create a web of knowledge that caters to your personal interest. Thus, it is crucial that the notes are connected to each other. 

### INDEXES

This type of note becomes most relevant when your Zettelkasten grows in size because it will become harder to navigate the different ideas just through their connections. The index or hub aims to solve this by creating an easy entry point to different trains of thoughts.  

## WORKFLOW 

Although the method is simple, it can take a bit of time to fully understand and internalize the process. Thus, it is important to understand the big picture flow of the method before diving into the details. 

The Zettelkasten method can be largely broken down into four main steps: 

1. **Capture**: The process of noting down ideas and thoughts that you encounter in your everyday life. 
2. **Process**: An important step where you looks over what you've captured and refine the thoughts and ideas that are relevant. The ideas that aren't relevant can be discarded in this step. 
3. **Connect**: Once the relevant ideas have been polished, it's time to see how this particular idea connects to the other ideas that are already in the system. 
4. **Create**: The interconnected ideas often form clusters that lead to unique ideas of its own that can be shared with others in the form of an output. 

Note that these steps are not a one time process. If you're continuously learning, you are continuously capturing, and if you are capturing you are processing and connecting. It is also not a linear process since one idea could lead you to start creating an output, which makes you realize you need more info. This is just a rough guideline of the process.
